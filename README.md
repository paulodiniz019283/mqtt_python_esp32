# README for ESP32 Sensor Data Capture and Storage Project with MQTT
Overview
This project demonstrates how to capture sensor data using an ESP32 board and transmit it to a server using the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. A Python script is used to receive MQTT data and insert it into a non-relational database, providing an efficient way to store and analyze sensor information.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:

An ESP32 board configured and connected to the sensors.
An MQTT server set up and running correctly.
Python installed on your system.
